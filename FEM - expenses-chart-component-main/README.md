## Overview

This is my 3rd project on Front-End mentor. I wanted to consolidate my use of flexbox before starting to learn grid.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

I use the mobile first approach. I focused on the typography then the top part and the bottom part.

Once everything was ok, I worked on the chart with flexbox and relative positioning.

Finally, I created the JavaScript in order to generate the bar and tooltip dynamically.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned use the relative/absolute properties on element to place them properly.

It was a good practice of flexbox.

I learn how to import a JSON file from local computer. It doesn't work on the live site because the code is based on my local host.
